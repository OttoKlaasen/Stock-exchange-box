# Stock-exchange-box
a 3D printed stock exchange box based on ESP8266 MCU controller

The Frans van Hout stock exchanged box is based on the stock exchange price of Philips.
The box contains a ESP8266 controller which pulls the stock exchange price via a API from Internet and displays the price on a 7 segment display.
The unit contains a green and red LED which indicates the average price last hour going up (green LED)  or down (Red LED).

In the published code we have changed the SSID and API keys which you need to replace by your own code.

The code needs to be inserted in Platform IO.
